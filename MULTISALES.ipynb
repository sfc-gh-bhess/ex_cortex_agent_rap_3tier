   "source": "# Cortex Agents for Multiple Tenants/Users\nThere are a number of use cases where we want to use the Cortex AI features of Snowflake but only give certain\nusers access to certain data in the database. \n\nFor example, we may have sales data for our company, and we want\nto create an application that lets our salespeople ask questions in a \"talk-to-your-data\" sort of fashion, but\nwe only want a salesperson to get access to the data about their customers and not other customers. Another\nexample is that we have an application that manages data for many tenants, and we want to allow a tenant to \nask questions of their data, but not get any access to other tenants' data.\n\nWe can accomplish this using Snowflake, leveraging the Cortex Agents feature for AI and the Row Access Policy\n(RAP) feature to restrict the data for the user.\n\nThis Notebook will walk you through the setup for a 3-tier web app that uses Cortex Agents to talk to your data\nand manages sales data for multiple tenants. Users will log in to the application and only see results related\nto the tenant they are associated with. The use case is managing restaurant sales data (how much each menu item\nis selling at each restaurant within each chain). \n\nThe high-level steps in the Notebook are:\n* set up a warehouse, database, and schema for this example\n* create a role for the example and grant it the necessary privileges to create the objects it needs\n* create a set of menu items (using Cortex to generate descriptions)\n* create a Cortex Search service for the menu items\n* create daily sales totals for each store in each restaurant\n* create a Programmatic Access Token (PAT) to allow our application to talk to Snowflake APIs\n* create a Row Access Policy based on the value in a session variable and apply it to the items and orders tables\n* print the environment variables that you will need to run the companion web app\n\n## Example Use Case\nThe example that we consider is a website that helps restaurant franchise owners analyze their sales\ndata. Franchises upload their menu items and descriptions to the service (we'll store that in the\n`ITEMS` table). Additionally, franchises send their sales data to this service, and that data is summarized\nfor daily sales (we'll store that in the `ORDERS` table). Each franchise has multiple stores, and the sales data is captured per store and per item. Just for illustration, the data in this demo contains sales data just for\nthe calendar year 2024.\n\nThe website allows for a franchise owner to log in and ask natuarl language questions about their menu\nand sales data. The franchise owner should only be able to see the data about their franchise. For exmaple,\nAlice, owner of Alices Restaurant, can analyze data about all of the Alices Restaurant stores, and cannot\nask questions about any other franchise, such as Bobs Place or Charlies Diner.\n\nSome of the types of questions that an owner might ask are:\n* _Which chicken sandwich sold the most in May 2024?_\n* _Which menu items that are not chicken sandwiches sold the least in April 2024?_\n* _Did we sell more sandwiches or burgers in June 2024?_\n* _Which menu item sold the most for all of 2024?_"

Row Access Policy\nNow we can turn our attention to protecting the data so that a given tenant can only access their own data.\n\nWe will use an entitlement table to map which users (`Alice`, `Bob`, and `Charlie`) can access data for which\ntenant (`Alices Restaurant`, `Bobs Place`, `Charlies Diner`). For now, each user can access their own \nrestaurant's tenant. If, say, Alice hires a new employee, say Arlo, then we just need to add a row for \nArlo allowing access to Alices Restaurant's data. It is quite simple and efficient to update the user access\nby simply updating the data in the entitlement table.\n\nNext, we will use a simple function to create an array of tenants that a given user has access to. This is \nessentially gathering all rows in the entitlement table for a given `USERID` and turning that into an\n`ARRAY`. We will create this function as a _memoizable_ function so that it can efficiently be calculated\nonce and the result reused without having to recalculate every time.\n\nLastly, we create the actual Row Access Policy which will compare the value of the `REP` input to the\narray of allowed tenants. We only use that logic if the current role is the `MULTISALES_RL`. This allows\nus to access all of the data (assuming we have been granted `SELECT` permission on the table) if we access\nit with a different role (e.g., `ACCOUNTADMIN`)."
